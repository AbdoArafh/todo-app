### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- Vanilla JavaScript
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)

### What I learned

I learned to use Vanilla JavaScript in a better way and utilize it
to make better solutions without any frameworks.

Even though using vanilla JavaScript was a bit stressfull and frustrating
at times. The joy of reinventing the wheel is sometimes worth it.

### Useful resources

was pretty usefull for me to make draggable notes
